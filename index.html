            <h2>Lake Zürich at night</h2>
            <img src="images/destination1.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                People swim and sail in the lake when the weather allows. There
                are even boats that are part of the public transport that 
                cross the whole lake. The whole trip takes around 2 hours 
                on a luxurious boat where they serve food and drinks.
                (During the first lockdown the levels of heroin in the lake 
                were 20 times the usual.)

            <img src="images/destination2.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                Zürich's is the smallest of the great international opera 
                houses, which makes the experience of being there even better.

            <img src="images/destination3.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                Visible are the two main churches in Zürich--Grossmünster
                to the right, Fraumünster to the left. To the left you 
                can also see the only swimming area where only women are 
                allowed. Before it was built the women of Zürich bathed
                in the city fountains during the night.

            <h2>Grand Café Odeon</h2>
            <img src="images/destination4.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                This charming café is not only one of the LGBTQ hotspots of 
                the city but is also the birthplace of the art movement
                Dadaism. James Joyce and Albert Einstein are just a few of 
                the many celebrities who were regulars there.

            <h2>Grossmünster</h2>
            <img src="images/destination5.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                Legend says that the three saints of the church were plunged
                into boiling oil and forced to drink molten lead for refusing
                to give up their faith. After they were beheaded they then 
                picked up their heads and went to the place where the church 
                stands now to dig their own graves and bury themselves.

            <h2>Fraumünster</h2>
            <img src="images/destination6.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                In medieval times the women of Fraumünster and especially
                the abbess held almost all of the economic and political 
                power in the region. They collected taxes and decided on 
                policies and on who the mayor was going to be. Unfortunately,
                they lost their power in the 14th century with the rise of 
                trade guilds that up to this date don’t allow women to enter.

            <h2>Hotel Hirschen and Platzhirsch Bar</h2>
            <img src="images/destination7.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                Both places were used by the fighters for the LGBTQ movement
                in Zürich during the 20th century. The hotel gave the members
                a room to gather and discuss strategies and it also let 
                homosexual couples rent rooms. For that the city cut off its
                electricity. A lot of rich foreigners stayed there at the time
                so the hotel staff lit candles and pretended it was just to 
                bring a better atmosphere.

            <h2>ETH Zürich</h2>
            <img src="images/destination8.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                This university is one of the largest in Switzerland. Each year 
                it hosts a Winter Ball that around ten thousand students 
                attend. The list of famous individuals who have studied there
                includes Albert Einstein and Wilhelm Röntgen, and of course me.

            <h2>View from University Terrace</h2>
            <img src="images/destination9.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                I had to include this one, taken from the place where all the 
                students gather after the lectures to drink a beer, chat or 
                simply to look at the city.

            <h2>Swiss National Museum</h2>
            <img src="images/destination10.jpg">
            <figcaption>
                This seemingly authentic castle was built in the 20th century 
                to serve as a museum. It has sections that are made to imitate
                different architectural styles throughout history. Next to it 
                is the only park in Zürich that gets locked during the night. 
                The reason for that is that during the 80s it was occupied by 
                drug addicts and police couldn’t get in. Now the park is a 
                popular place to gather and even party.
