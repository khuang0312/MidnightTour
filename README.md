# MidnightTour
This is a webpage showing a simple photo gallery of my online friend's midnight walk through ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.

On the site, there is a photo gallery containing 10 photos of places throughout the city.
The site is meant to be simple in order to help me practice using HTML, CSS, and JS.
I have learned about the DOM, JS execution order, and CSS.

This project is complete. I might end up revising it at some point but for the most part, it is finished.
